\chapter{1584. Min Cost to Connect All Points}
\section{Description}
You are given an array points representing integer coordinates of some points on a 2D-plane, where points[i] = [xi, yi].
\\
The cost of connecting two points [xi, yi] and [xj, yj] is the manhattan distance between them: |xi - xj| + |yi - yj|, where |val| denotes the absolute value of val.
\\
Return the minimum cost to make all points connected. All points are connected if there is exactly one simple path between any two points.

\section{Attempt 1}
Interesting problem, not sure exactly where I went wrong. Maybe I need to use the given vector more to conserve memory.
\begin{lstlisting}
class Solution {
public:
    int minCostConnectPoints(vector<vector<int>>& points) {
        int out = 0;
        bool connect[points.size()];
        memset(connect, 0, points.size());
        connect[0] = true;
        std::vector<int> dis(points.size(), INT_MAX);
        int curr = 0;
        for (int i = 1; i < points.size(); i++) {
            int min = 0;
            for (int j = 1; j < points.size(); j++) {
                if (!connect[j]) {
                    int tmp = man(points[curr], points[j]);
                    if (tmp < dis[j]) dis[j] = tmp;
                    if (dis[j] < dis[min]) min = j;
                }
            }
            connect[min] = true;
            curr = min;
            out += dis[min];
        }
        return out;
    }
    int man(vector<int> A, vector<int> B) {
        return abs(A[0] - B[0]) + abs(A[1] - B[1]);
    }
};
\end{lstlisting}
